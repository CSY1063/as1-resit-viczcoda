            Hello im victor Ekissi and this is a final site report of my website and how i progressed.
            The journey of creating this investion showed ways of how to keep areas of my code more
            simple, in addition to working with innovation. Working with this piece of code made me be
            persistent and think of ideas to help me organise certain areas. Although the layout
            of the site is simple it took alot of mind power to create. At the beginning i was left blank
            with no ideas at all and being scared to start beacuse I was too afraid to take up a challenge,
            I could overcome easily, eventhough I lacked the commitment to start and stay consistent.
            Time went by and I realised I needed to put ideas to action. So I started looking at websites 
            which inspired me to create web designs with a simple layout. I looked at mainly desinger websites 
            as I knew some websites portrayed a simplistic layout that I could replicate. Shortly I found 
            out that this wasnt as easy as I thought it was and so I got started with creating a a template 
            of scratch. The lecture videos really helped alot with the development of the grid however I think 
            coming in to the lessons helped even more especially from the help of chris. One mistake I made 
            with this was not asking chris for help at all as well as lacking in working on my website during 
            the lession to have a better view of my progress. Progressing futher into the weeks I decided to 
            keep my ideas basic and to just complete eatch part of the website with organisation. Eventually this 
            lead to creating a more managable template and it felt like a breath of fresh air.I got used
            to working within eat css style and its element and by using a basic stlye within to lay out my 
            designs, bit by bit I finally ended up with the current result I present today.
